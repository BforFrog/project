NOTE ABOUT CUTSCENES:
  	Cutscenes will replay ever time until the game is beaten at least once, to stop it from playing set game_data["replay"] to True by default

	- Some parts will not display correctly if constant dimensions are changes
	- Game cannot be exited during story parts
	- Sprites look slightly smaller than actual hitbox
	- resources are stored in resources folder
	- sprite.py contains sprite class
	- run comp1501_w21_101141633_a2_main.py to play the game
	- art by me
